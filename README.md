# 🛠️ Fix It Now  

**Fix It Now** is a property maintenance management application that connects **tenants** and **property admins** in one place.  
It replaces manual calls, emails, or WhatsApp messages with a **streamlined system** for reporting, tracking, and resolving issues quickly and transparently.  

---

## 📌 Overview  
Property management often relies on outdated communication methods. Tenants report issues by phone or text, admins manually track requests, and there’s little transparency in how problems are resolved.  

**Fix It Now** solves this by:  
- Giving tenants an easy way to report issues (with photos/videos).  
- Allowing admins to track and update issue statuses in real time.  
- Supporting multiple admins per property, with different permission levels.  
- Creating transparency and accountability with status history, notifications, and reports.  

The result: **faster resolutions, fewer miscommunications, and better tenant satisfaction.**

## ⚙️ How It Works  
1. Tenants log in, select their property/unit, and submit a maintenance request.  
2. The request is tracked through statuses: **Pending → In Progress → Completed**.  
3. Admins review requests, update statuses, and communicate directly with tenants.  
4. Tenants confirm resolution and provide feedback.
